# Cute Kubernetes Logo
Uh, yeah, Kubernetes but cute.

- V1 is the original version I made.
- V2 removes the pink parts which are inside the logo and the small ones on top to make a sticker version look nicer.
- V3 removes the little visible bit of box inside the U, and features the same changes as V2.
- V4 has a change to the hiragana as one character was under and the rest over the "Kubernetes" part, leading to confusion.

If you want them mixed and matched or want some other change, feel free to raise an issue. This logo is made by me, Alex, replicating the cute anime/vtuber style currently trending.
